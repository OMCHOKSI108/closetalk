**Multi-device hub features:**
- Tracks clients by `(chatID)` for chat broadcasting AND `(userID, deviceID)` for user-level fan-out
- `broadcastToChat(chatID, msg, excludeUserID)` — existing chat broadcast behavior
- `broadcastToUserDevices(userID, msg, excludeDeviceID)` — pushes to ALL devices of a recipient
- `disconnectDevice(userID, deviceID)` — force-close a specific device's WebSocket connection
- `subscribeToChat / unsubscribeFromChat` — subscribe/unsubscribe to additional chat rooms
- WebSocket protocol: `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` message types for dynamic chat joining

**New endpoints (added to message-service):**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/sync/messages?after=cursor` | Incremental sync — fetches messages across all user's conversations |

**Sync behavior:**
- Queries Neon for user's conversation participants, then ScyllaDB for messages in each conversation
- Default: syncs last 30 days of messages
- Cursor-based pagination (50 per page)
- Sorted by created_at descending (newest first)
- Exponential backoff on retry (Flutter client: 2^n * 1s, max 5 retries)

**Flutter SyncService:**
- `syncMessages()` — fetch next batch since last cursor
- `fullSync()` — fetches ALL messages in batches with progress callback
- `resetCursor()` — reset sync state (e.g. after device link)
- Auto-retry with exponential backoff on connection failure

**Verification:**
- [x] `go vet ./...` — zero issues
- [x] `go build ./cmd/auth-service/` — builds clean (17MB)
- [x] `go build ./cmd/message-service/` — builds clean
